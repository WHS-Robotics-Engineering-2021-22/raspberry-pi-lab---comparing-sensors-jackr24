<p> The sensors can detect movement or heat in the environment, and when changes happen, it sends a signal to something.</p>
<p> If it is hot then maybe the sensor won't detect a hand or if there is a lot of moving things then the sensor could miss a moving hand.</p>
<p> Coding allows the signal to be sent; it lets the sensor know that now, it should send a signal to whatever it is hooked up to.</p>
